#What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.

#In Python, tuples are assigned by placing the values or "elements" of data inside round brackets "()." 
# Commas must separate these items.

tuple1=(1,2,3,4)
tuple2=("a","b","c")
tuple3=(1,"b",2)

print(tuple1)
print(tuple2)
print(tuple3)



#The literal syntax of tuples is shown by parentheses () whereas the literal syntax of lists is shown by square brackets [] .
#Lists has variable length, tuple has fixed length.
#List has mutable nature, tuple has immutable nature.
#List has more functionality than the tuple.
